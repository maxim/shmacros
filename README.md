Install
-------
  
    script/plugin install git://github.com/maxim/shmacros.git

Unit Macros
-----------

- `should_accept_nested_attributes_for :foo, :bar` 
  
  Verifies that `accepts_nested_attribtes_for` is declared for given attributes.

- `should_act_as_taggable_on :category_name`

  Verifies that `acts_as_taggable_on` is declared for optionally given category.

- `should_be ClassName`

  Verifies that tested model `is_a?(ClassName)`.

- `should_callback :method_name, :after_save`

  Verifies that given callback (`:method_name`) is declared for given event (`:after_save`).

- `should_delegate :foo, :bar, :to => :elsewhere, :allow_nil => true`

  Verifies that `delegates` is declared for given method to given destination. Also tests `:allow_nil` functionality introduced in Rails 2.3.3.

- `should_validate_associated :foo, :bar`

  Verifies that `validates_associated` is declared for given attributes.

- `should_deny_values :country => %w(Africa Europe), :zipcode => "fake_code"`

  Verifies that tested model is invalid when given attributes are assigned corresponding values.
  As opposed to shoulda's similar method, this implementation doesn't compare error messages, just checks for error presence on attribute.

- `should_allow_values :country => %w(England Russia), :zipcode => "55555"`

  Verifies that tested model is valid when given attributes are assigned corresponding values.
  As opposed to shoulda's similar method, this implementation doesn't compare error messages, just checks for error presence on attribute.

- `should_allow_mass_assignment_of :foo, :bar, :strict => true`

  Overrides Shoulda's `should_allow_mass_assignment_of` to add the convenience option `:strict => true`. When `:strict` is `true` every non-listed attribute is explicitly tested for mass assignment protection.
  
Functional Macros
-----------------

- `should_rest_route :show, :new, :create`

  Provides shortcut to declaring multiple `should_route` tests if routes are supposed to be REST-style. If action names are omitted defaults to testing all 7 RESTful actions. Accepts option `:singular => true` for singular routes such as profile or account controller. Usually guesses controller name, but can be overridden with `:controller => "Profile"` option.
